The following CSS code snippet causes unexpected behavior in some browsers due to specificity issues:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `p` element within a `div` should ideally be blue, but due to the order of declaration, the second rule (more specific) overrides the first, resulting in red text.

This problem becomes more complex and harder to debug in larger stylesheets.
