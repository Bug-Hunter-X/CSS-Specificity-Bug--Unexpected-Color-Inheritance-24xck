The solution involves adjusting the CSS specificity to ensure the desired behavior:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
div p {
  color: blue;
}
```

By placing the more specific rule (`div p`) after the less specific rule (`p`), we ensure the browser correctly applies the blue color to the paragraph within the div.  Alternatively, we could increase the specificity of `div p` by adding extra selectors or using the `!important` flag, but this is generally considered less maintainable.
